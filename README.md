An interactive app designed for OSC OnDemand that launches a Jupyter
server within an Pitzer batch job.

## Deprecated application warning

This application no longer works.  It raises an exception when users attempt to submit jobs.
This is because we now have functionality to submit to multiple clusters and
[the generic application](https://github.com/OSC/bc_osc_jupyter) now submits
to pitzer rendering this application useless.

For historic versions, see the last released you can still view
[v0.13.0](https://github.com/OSC/bc_osc_jupyter_pitzer/tree/v0.13.0) as it was the last
working version of this application.
