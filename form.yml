      CUDA is Nvidia's GPU-specific parallel computing framework. A GPU node
      is required to make use of this functionality.

      - **any** - (*1-40 cores*) Chooses anyone of the available Pitzer nodes.
        This reduces the wait time as you have no requirements. Standard Pitzer
        nodes have 192GB of memory.
      - **gpu** - (*1-40 cores*) This node includes two [NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs]
        and loads the [CUDA] 9.2.88 module. This node has 384GB of memory.
        There are currently only 32 of these nodes on Pitzer.
      - **hugemem** - (*80 cores*) This Pitzer node has 3TB of memory as
        well as 80 cores. There are only 4 of these nodes on Pitzer. A
        reservation may be required to use this node.
      - **debug** - (*1-40 cores*) For short sessions (= 1 hour) the debug queue
        will have the shortest wait time. This is only accessible during 8AM -
        6PM, Monday - Friday. There are 6 of these nodes on Pitzer.
